    <h1>MIDAS Historical Background</h1>
    <p>
        MIDAS Touch Multipurpose cooperative societyâ€™s vision is to be a leading multipurpose cooperative society in Nigerian civil
        service. Leadership for us is defined by the value of our franchise and the cooperator experience we deliver. At
        the center of our organization, lies a talented workforce, focused on providing comprehensive, yet simple and reliable,
        services to cooperators. Our services include personal savings, bam, private public partnership and fixed deposit
        scheme.
    </p>
    <p>MIDAS Touch multipurpose society roots date back to 2015, to encourage thrift amongst members working in Federal Medical
        Centre Makurdi and to establish a fund from which members can access loans at reasonable and affordable interest
        rate. The idea for the establishment of the cooperative was proposed in September 2014 after feelings of dissatisfaction
        with the operations of several other existing cooperatives within the hospital and the need to add value to what
        was commonly obtained within the hospital among the financial organizations. Mr Shimakaa Iorlumun led the call and
        discussion on the need to have a financial organization built on trust, professionalism that can add value to its
        members. Early discussants to the vision were Manasseh Tivkaa, Mker Martins, Anande Godwin, Sesugh Denen, Torough
        Ternenge and Tersoo Apaa.</p>

    <p>Though, not all the above mentioned personalities translated this discussions into realities as some declined being members
        of the first set of executive committee stating not everyone will lead at the same time. The eventual take off of
        the cooperative was with the following as its steering committee members; Shimakaa Iorlumun, Uche Azuka, Sesugh Denen,
        Eronini Gilbert, Ternenge Torough, Apaa Tersoo and Edigah Felicia. The ingenuity which the current management has
        brought into play, made us feel that while we are moving forward, we will keep sight of our origin to improve upon
        it and to be always aware of it. This is the essence of the new cooperative Midas touch in presenting a total savings
        concept desirable for our current focus on meeting the welfare needs of its members, encourage bam, PPP as well as
        not abandoning personal fixed deposit savings for the high net worth cooperators. To see such a well-conceived organization
        springing up from a competitive environment, brought into my mind again, some of the driving forces that led to the
        Vision of a robust saving platform that will not be taken away from their control.</p>

    <p>The cooperative within the period of its existence has made notable progress since commencement, both in membership and
        building its financial base. Noteworthy achievement includes but not limited to;
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>i. Increase in membership base from the initial 120 to 924 members</li>
            <li>ii. Increase in disbursable dividend from N1,760,966.67 to over N8,000,000.00 within one year.</li>
            <li>iii. Construction and furnishing of a befitting office for the cooperative.</li>
            <li>iv. Employment of two secretariat staff.</li>
            <li>v. Corporate social responsibility to the hospital community.</li>
            <li>vi. Digitalization/computerization of cooperative business.</li>
            <li>vii. Introduction of welfare package</li>
            <li>viii. Unveiling of standard of operation policy for the cooperative. </li>
        </ul>
        Let me conclude by asking everyone to join us in thanking God for giving us a Vision that has the potential of attracting
        all and sundry to save with us. God bless us all.
